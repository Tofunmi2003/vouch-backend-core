 // to identify in JS add an id to html file 
 // to select and find in JS you use getElementById('yButton')
 // if you want to trigger the button or tell it 
 // what to do the you make us of 
 // addEventlistener("click", "function()") and then 
 // you can write the function that you want to trigger when the button is clicked.")

 //Variables 
 // Assigning a value to a variable
 // let name  = "John Doe";
//  var name = "John Doe";
//Declaring a variable 
//let age;// let is used for variables that can be reassigned a value or canged later in the code 
//var age ;
//const age; // Const is used to declare a variabl if the value will remained unchanged 
// alwways use let and const instead of var because var is function scoped and can lead to unexpected behavior in larger codebases.
// function scope is accessible anywhere in the funtion
//Block Scope is only accessible within the block it is defined in
